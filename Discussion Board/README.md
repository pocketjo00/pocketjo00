This discussion board was the result of a group-based semesters long course. My contributions included the resolve and unresolve function, delete confirmation, as well as some of the JUnit testing especially when it came to testing the resolve and delete functions. This project allowed me to expand on my technical skills with working with a database, implementing JUnit testing, as well as technical documentation. With personal skills, it allowed me an opportunity to experience an agile team environment, conflict resolution, and time management.
